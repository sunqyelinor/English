Habits are a funny thing.
We reach for them mindlessly,setting our brains on auto-pilot and relaxing into the unconscious comfort of 
familiar routine.
"Not choice,but habits rules the unreflecting herd,"William Wordsworth said in the 19th century.
In the ever-changing 21st century,even the word "habit"carries a negative implication.So it seems paradoxcal to 
talk about habits in the same context as creativity and innovation.But brain researchers have discovered that when we 
consciously develop new habits,we create parallel paths,and even entirely new brain cells,that can jump our trains 
of thought onto new, innovative tracks.Rather than dismissing ourselves as unchangeable creatures of habits,we can
instead direct our own change bu consciously developing new habits.In fact,the more new things we try- the more we
step outside our comfort zone- the more inherently creative we become,both in the workplace and in our personal lives.
But don't bother trying to kill off old habits;once those ruts of precedure are worn into the brain,they're there
to stay.Instead,the new habits we deliberately press into ourselves create parallel pathways that can bypass those
old roads."The first thing needed for innovation is a fascination with wonder,"says Dawna Markova,author of "The 
Open Mind"."But we are taught to 'decide,'just as our president calls himself 'the Decider.'"She adds,however,that
"to decide is to kill off all possibilities but one".A good innovational thingker is always exploring the many 
other possibilities."All of us work through problems in ways of which we are unaware,she says.Researchers in the 
late 1960 discovered that humans are born with the capacity to approach challenges in four primary ways:analytically,
procedurally,relationally(collaboratively)and innovatively.At the end of adolecence,however,the brain shuts down
half of that capacity,preserving only those modes of thought that have seemed most valuable during the first decade 
or so of life.The current emphasis on standaried testing highlights analysis and procedure,meaning that few of us
inherently use our innovstive and collaborative modes of thought."This breaks the major rule in the American belief
system- that anyone can do anything"explains M.J.Ryan,author of the 2006 book"This Year I Will..."and Ms.Markova's 
business partner."That's a lie that we have perpetuated ,and it fosters commonness.Knowing what you're good at and
doing even more of it creats excellence."This is where developing new habits comes in.
