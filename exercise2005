The human nose is an underrated【adj.被低估的】 tool.
Humans are often thought to be insensitive compared with animanls,
but this is largely because,unlike animals,we stand upright.
This means that our noses are limited to perceiving those smells [区别：limit 限制在一个范围， confine 强调自由，不能随心]
which float throught the air,missing the majority of smells which stick to surfaces.
In fact,though,we are extremely sensitive to smells,even if we do not generally realize it.
[if only 表示虚拟；only if 表示条件(只有)；as if 表示方式，好像]
Our noses are capable of detecting human smells even when these are detecting to far below one part in one million.
[辨析：distinguish 强调用眼睛和耳朵去辨别；discover 强调已存在的事物被发现；determine 强调不明确的事物变明确；
detect 强调察觉到不易察觉的事物]
[辨析：diluted 稀释；dissolve 溶解 ；disperse 驱散，驱散，疏散；diffuse 传播]
Strangely,some people find that they can smell one type of flower but not another,whereas others are sentitive to
the smells of both flowers.This may be because some people do not have the genes necessary to generate particular
smell receptors in the nose. These receptors are the cells which sense smells and send messages to the brain.
However,it has been found that even people insensitive to a certain smell at first can suddenly become sensitive to
it when exposed [接触] to it often enough.
The explanation for insensitivity to smell seems to be that the brain finds it inefficient to keep all smell receptors 
working all the time but can create new receptors if necessary. 
[辨析：incompetent 形容人没有能力 ;ineffective 无效果的，没用的；inefficient 低效率的]
[辨析：summon 传唤人，召集；trigger 引发，启动，表示前因后果的关系]
This may also explain why we are not sensitive to our own smells -we simply do not neeed to be.We are not aware of the 
usual smell of our own house, but we notice new smells when we visit someone else's.The brain finds it best to keep smell
receptors available for unfamiliar and emergency signals such as the smell of smoke, which might indicate the danger of fire.
